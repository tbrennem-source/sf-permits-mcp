# BLACKBOX_PROTOCOL.md — Autonomous Build Session Protocol

**Owner:** dforge
**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-25

---

## What This File Is

This is the executable protocol for autonomous Claude Code build sessions. It is not advisory. It is not a template to customize. CC reads this file and follows it literally.

Every repo that uses the Black Box pattern includes this line in its CLAUDE.md:

```
## Black Box Protocol: active
See BLACKBOX_PROTOCOL.md for the mandatory session structure.
```

CC must read this file at session start. If this file is not present, CC must stop and ask where it is before building anything.

---

## Session Structure

Every Black Box session has exactly two stages. Both are mandatory. Neither can be skipped.

### Stage 1: termCC (Terminal Claude Code)

Runs in terminal. Builds code, runs tests, generates QA artifacts.

**Phase order is fixed. Do not reorder. Do not skip phases.**

```
READ → BUILD → TEST → SCENARIOS → QA → CHECKCHAT
```

#### READ

1. Read this file (BLACKBOX_PROTOCOL.md)
2. Read the repo's CLAUDE.md
3. Read the repo's DEPLOYMENT_MANIFEST.yaml (location declared in CLAUDE.md)
4. Read the mission prompt (the task you were given)
5. Read any spec files referenced in the mission prompt

**Gate:** Do not proceed to BUILD until you can state:
- What topology this repo uses (from manifest)
- What URLs you will verify against (from manifest)
- How many DeskRelay prompts you must generate (from manifest)

#### BUILD

Build what the mission prompt says. Follow the repo's PRINCIPALS.md and CLAUDE.md rules.

**Rules during BUILD:**
- No curl/fetch against prod URLs. Staging only.
- No database mutations against prod. Staging only.
- If the manifest says `topology: two-branch`, all remote operations target staging until DeskRelay-staging passes and promotion occurs.

#### TEST

Run the repo's test suite. All tests must pass.

```bash
# Standard pattern — repo may override in CLAUDE.md
pytest tests/ -v
```

**Gate:** Do not proceed to SCENARIOS if tests fail. Fix failures first. After 3 failed fix attempts, mark as BLOCKED and proceed to CHECKCHAT with BLOCKED status.

#### SCENARIOS

Append suggested scenarios to `scenarios-pending-review.md` in the repo root. Create the file if it doesn't exist.

**Rules:**
- CC does NOT modify `scenario-design-guide.md` or any authoritative scenario file
- Scenarios go to the staging file only
- Use the format defined in the repo's CLAUDE.md
- Aim for 2-5 scenarios per session
- Tag each with CC confidence: high / medium / low

#### QA (termRelay)

Spawn QA subagents using headless Playwright. Each subagent:
- Navigates to the **staging URL** (from manifest, never prod)
- Takes screenshots to `qa-results/screenshots/{sprint-id}/`
- Writes PASS/FAIL results to `qa-results/{sprint-id}-staging-results.md`

**Subagent categories** (spawn what's relevant, skip what isn't):
- **Public:** Landing page, search, unauthenticated features
- **Auth:** Login flow, authenticated features
- **Admin:** Admin-only features, cron endpoints
- **API:** Health checks, data endpoints

**Gate:** All relevant subagent categories must PASS before proceeding to CHECKCHAT. After 3 failed fix attempts per category, mark as BLOCKED.

#### CHECKCHAT

Session close protocol. Six steps, all mandatory.

**Step 1 — VERIFY:** Confirm QA gate status. List any BLOCKED items.

**Step 2 — DOCUMENT:** Update STATUS.md and CHANGELOG.md in the repo.

**Step 3 — CAPTURE:** Confirm scenarios were appended to `scenarios-pending-review.md`.

**Step 4 — SHIP:** Push to the repo's development branch (usually `main`). Update Chief if the repo uses Chief Hub Protocol.

**Step 5 — GENERATE DESKRELAY PROMPTS:** This is mandatory. Read the DEPLOYMENT_MANIFEST.yaml and generate the correct number of DeskRelay prompt files.

> **This step is not optional. This step cannot be skipped. If you close a session without generating DeskRelay prompts, the session is incomplete.**

See [DeskRelay Prompt Generation](#deskrelay-prompt-generation) below for the exact rules.

**Step 6 — BLOCKED ITEMS REPORT:** List anything that couldn't be completed, with root cause and suggested next step.

Output the CHECKCHAT summary to the terminal. Include the line:

```
DESKRELAY PROMPTS: qa-drop/{sprint-id}-deskrelay-staging-prompt.md, qa-drop/{sprint-id}-deskrelay-prod-prompt.md
```

(Adjust count based on manifest topology.)

### Stage 2: DeskCC (Desktop Claude Code)

Runs in Desktop Claude Code. Visual verification only. No code changes except the promotion ceremony.

DeskCC receives a DeskRelay prompt file generated by Stage 1. It executes exactly what that file says. When done, it runs a lightweight CHECKCHAT: commit QA artifacts, push, note any follow-ups.

**DeskCC rules:**
- No code changes (except git promotion commands if specified in the prompt)
- Only produces QA artifacts (screenshots, results files)
- If a visual check fails, document the failure — do NOT attempt to fix code

---

## DeskRelay Prompt Generation

This is the most important section of this protocol. Getting this wrong means prod goes unverified.

### Read the Manifest

The repo's `DEPLOYMENT_MANIFEST.yaml` declares the topology. The topology determines how many DeskRelay prompts to generate and what each one verifies.

### Topology: `no-deploy`

Library or tool with no deployment. Zero DeskRelay prompts needed. Skip Step 5.

### Topology: `single-branch`

One environment, one branch, one URL.

**Generate 1 file:** `qa-drop/{sprint-id}-deskrelay-prompt.md`

Contents:
1. `cd {repo_path}` (from manifest)
2. Visual checks against the single environment URL
3. Screenshots to `qa-results/screenshots/{sprint-id}-deskrelay/`
4. Results to `qa-results/{sprint-id}-deskrelay-results.md`
5. Lightweight CHECKCHAT (commit, push)

### Topology: `two-branch`

Two environments (staging + prod), two branches, promotion ceremony between them.

**Generate 2 files:**

**File 1:** `qa-drop/{sprint-id}-deskrelay-staging-prompt.md`
1. `cd {repo_path}`
2. Visual checks against `staging_url` (from manifest)
3. Screenshots to `qa-results/screenshots/{sprint-id}-deskrelay-staging/`
4. Results to `qa-results/{sprint-id}-deskrelay-staging-results.md`
5. **If all checks PASS:** Run the promotion ceremony:
   ```
   {promotion_command}
   ```
   (Exact command from manifest. Do not improvise.)
6. Wait for prod deploy (manifest specifies `deploy_wait_seconds`)
7. Run any `post_promotion_commands` from manifest (migrations, data loads, etc.)
8. Lightweight CHECKCHAT (commit, push)
9. Tell the operator to run the prod DeskRelay prompt next

**File 2:** `qa-drop/{sprint-id}-deskrelay-prod-prompt.md`
1. `cd {repo_path}`
2. Visual checks against `prod_url` (from manifest)
3. Same check categories as staging prompt
4. Screenshots to `qa-results/screenshots/{sprint-id}-deskrelay-prod/`
5. Results to `qa-results/{sprint-id}-deskrelay-prod-results.md`
6. Lightweight CHECKCHAT (commit, push, update Chief if applicable)

### What Every DeskRelay Prompt Must Contain

Regardless of topology, every generated DeskRelay prompt must include:

1. **Repo path** — `cd` command at the top
2. **Target URL** — which environment to verify
3. **Health check** — hit the health endpoint, verify response
4. **Visual checks** — numbered steps with explicit PASS/FAIL criteria
5. **Screenshot paths** — where to save evidence
6. **Results file path** — where to write the report
7. **No-code-changes rule** — explicit statement that DeskCC must not modify code
8. **Lightweight CHECKCHAT** — commit QA artifacts, push

### DeskRelay Prompt Template

```markdown
# DeskRelay: {sprint-id} — {environment} Verification

## Setup
cd {repo_path}

## Environment
**Target:** {url}
**Type:** {staging|prod}

## Rules
- NO code changes. QA artifacts only.
- If a check fails, document it. Do NOT attempt fixes.
- Screenshots go to: qa-results/screenshots/{sprint-id}-deskrelay-{env}/
- Results go to: qa-results/{sprint-id}-deskrelay-{env}-results.md

## Health Check
curl -s {url}/health | python3 -m json.tool
Expected: 200 response with table counts.

## Visual Checks

1. [ ] Landing page loads — title contains expected text
2. [ ] Search works — enter "{test_query}", results appear
3. [ ] {additional checks from termRelay HANDOFF section}

## Post-Checks
{Only in staging prompt for two-branch: promotion ceremony}
{Only in prod prompt: "Update Chief with final status"}

## Close
Lightweight CHECKCHAT:
- Commit all screenshots and results files
- Push to {branch}
- Note any failures as follow-up items
```

---

## Enforcement Rules

These rules exist because CC has historically violated them. They are the teeth.

### E-1: No Prod Before Staging
CC must not curl, fetch, query, or interact with `prod_url` during Stage 1 (termCC). The only exception is read-only health checks for comparison purposes, and only after staging health check passes.

### E-2: No Skipping DeskRelay Generation
CHECKCHAT is not complete without DeskRelay prompt files. If the CHECKCHAT summary does not include the `DESKRELAY PROMPTS:` line, the session is incomplete. Go back and generate them.

### E-3: No Custom Deployment Steps
CC must not invent deployment commands. All deployment commands come from `DEPLOYMENT_MANIFEST.yaml`. If a needed command isn't in the manifest, flag it as a BLOCKED item — do not improvise.

### E-4: No Prose URLs
CC must not write URLs from memory. All URLs come from the manifest. Copy-paste, not recall.

### E-5: Test Before Ship
`git push` must not happen before `pytest` passes. This is not negotiable.

### E-6: Three Strikes
Any failing step gets 3 fix attempts. After 3 failures, mark BLOCKED and move on. Do not loop indefinitely.

### E-7: Manifest Is Canon
If the mission prompt contradicts the manifest (e.g., "deploy to prod first"), the manifest wins. Flag the contradiction in CHECKCHAT but follow the manifest.

## How Repos Adopt This Protocol

1. Add `DEPLOYMENT_MANIFEST.yaml` to repo root
2. Add to CLAUDE.md:
   ```
   ## Black Box Protocol: active
   ## Deployment Manifest: DEPLOYMENT_MANIFEST.yaml
   ```
3. Ensure `qa-drop/` and `qa-results/` directories exist (or are created on first run)
4. Done. CC reads the protocol, reads the manifest, follows the rules.
