# Changelog

## Phase 2 — Network Model Validation (2026-02-13)

### DuckDB Ingestion Pipeline (`src/ingest.py`)
- Paginated fetch (10K/page) of 3 contact datasets via existing `SODAClient`
  - Building Permits Contacts (`3pee-9qhc`, ~1M records)
  - Electrical Permits Contacts (`fdm7-jqqf`, ~340K records)
  - Plumbing Permits Contacts (`k6kv-9kix`, ~503K records)
- Building Permits (`i98e-djp9`, ~1.28M records) ingested for enrichment
- Building Inspections (`vckc-dh2h`, ~671K records) ingested for inspector data
- Unified `contacts` table normalizes names, roles, and keys across all three schemas
- `estimated_cost` cast from TEXT to DOUBLE during ingestion
- Ingest log tracks last-fetched timestamp per dataset

### DuckDB Schema (`src/db.py`)
- 6 tables: `contacts`, `entities`, `relationships`, `permits`, `inspections`, `ingest_log`
- 16 indexes on join columns: `permit_number`, `pts_agent_id`, `license_number`, `sf_business_license`, `entity_id`, `inspector`, `canonical_name`, etc.

### Entity Resolution (`src/entities.py`)
- 5-step cascading pipeline:
  1. `pts_agent_id` grouping (building contacts only, high confidence)
  2. `license_number` grouping across all sources (medium confidence, merges into existing entities)
  3. `sf_business_license` grouping across all sources (medium confidence, merges into existing entities)
  4. Fuzzy name matching with trigram-prefix blocking and token-set Jaccard similarity >= 0.75 (low confidence)
  5. Singleton entity creation for remaining unresolved contacts
- Canonical name/firm selection picks longest non-null value
- Entity type determined by most common role across grouped contacts

### Co-occurrence Graph (`src/graph.py`)
- Self-join on `contacts` table (a.entity_id < b.entity_id on shared permit_number)
- LEFT JOIN to `permits` for cost, type, date, neighborhood enrichment
- Edge attributes: shared_permits count, permit_numbers (capped at 20), permit_types, date range, total_estimated_cost, neighborhoods
- All computation in a single INSERT...SELECT pushed to DuckDB
- 1-hop neighbor and N-hop network traversal queries

### Validation & Anomaly Detection (`src/validate.py`)
- `search_entity(name)` — case-insensitive LIKE search on canonical_name/firm, returns top 5 co-occurring entities
- `entity_network(entity_id, hops)` — N-hop ego network with nodes and edges
- `inspector_contractor_links(inspector_name)` — traces inspector to permit to contact entity relationships
- `find_clusters(min_size, min_edge_weight)` — connected-component detection via BFS on filtered subgraph
- `anomaly_scan(min_permits)` — flags high permit volume (>3x type median), inspector concentration (>=50%), geographic concentration (>=80%), fast approvals (<7 days, >$100K)
- `run_ground_truth()` — searches for Rodrigo Santos, Florence Kong (inspectors), Bernard Curran (contact)

### New MCP Tools
- `search_entity` — search entities by name across all resolved contact data
- `entity_network` — get N-hop relationship network around an entity
- `network_anomalies` — scan for anomalous patterns in the permit network

### Tests
- 16 new tests in `tests/test_phase2.py` (in-memory DuckDB, no network access):
  - Schema creation verification
  - Entity resolution helpers: `_pick_canonical_name`, `_pick_canonical_firm`, `_most_common_role`, `_token_set_similarity`
  - Full entity resolution pipeline with cross-source merging assertions
  - Graph construction and edge weight verification
  - 1-hop neighbor and N-hop network queries
  - Entity search (found and not-found cases)
  - Inspector-contractor link tracing
  - Anomaly scan structure
  - Cluster detection

### Configuration
- Added `duckdb` to dependencies in `pyproject.toml`
- Added `data/` to `.gitignore` (DuckDB file not committed)

## Phase 1 — MCP Server + Dataset Catalog (2026-02-12)

### MCP Tools (5)
- `search_permits` — search building permits by neighborhood, type, status, cost, date, address, description
- `get_permit_details` — full details for a specific permit by permit number
- `permit_stats` — aggregate statistics grouped by neighborhood, type, status, month, or year
- `search_businesses` — search registered business locations in SF
- `property_lookup` — property assessments by address or block/lot

### Infrastructure
- FastMCP server entry point (`src/server.py`)
- Custom async SODA client with httpx (`src/soda_client.py`, ~108 lines)
- Response formatters for Claude consumption (`src/formatters.py`)
- 22 datasets cataloged in `datasets/catalog.json` and `datasets/CATALOG.md`
- SODA API performance benchmarks across 7 datasets (`benchmarks/RESULTS.md`)
- 10 integration tests in `tests/test_tools.py`

### Documentation
- Architecture decisions log (`docs/DECISIONS.md`): build-vs-fork, SODA client choice, NIXPACKS deployment
- Contact data deep-dive (`docs/contact-data-report.md`)
- Mehri reference model (`docs/mehri-reference.md`)

### Key Findings
- Baseline SODA API latency: ~450-650ms per query
- Aggregation cold-cache penalty: 10-14s on large datasets (warm cache: ~600ms)
- 13.3M total records across 22 datasets
