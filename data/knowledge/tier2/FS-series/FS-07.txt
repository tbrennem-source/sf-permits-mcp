PURPOSE

DISCUSSION

The purpose of this Information Sheet is to clarify the requirements for residential
deck and deck stairway protection at the property lines located at the rear or side
yards in alterations to existing buildings.

San Francisco Building Code, Current Edition

California Building Code (CBC), Current Edition

CBC Section 705.2 Exterior Walls, Projections

CBC Section 705.8 Exterior Walls, Openings

CBC Section 705.11 Exterior Walls, Parapets

CBC Section 1015 Guards

CBC Section 1027.5 Exterior Exit Stairways and Ramps, Location

Residential decks and deck stairways in the rear or side yards represent an
opening in exterior wall lines.

The fire separation distance (FSD) measured from property line for such openings are governed by CBC
Table 705.8, unless a one-hour fire-resistive wall is provided extending from the ground to 30 inches
above the walking surface of the deck and deck stairway. Note that guard requirements per CBC Section

1015 apply.

Without a fire-resistive wall, the minimum fire separation distance (FSD) of the deck and deck stairway
from the property line shall be as follows:

1. For R3 buildings, FSD = 3 feet or more.
2. For R2 buildings, FSD = 5 feet or more, with the exception of egress components.

The discussion on “decks’ in this information sheet is in reference to residential decks, which are exterior
platforms built above the ground and connected to the main building. It is delineated from “balconies” or
pool “decks” as defined by CBC Section 202.
