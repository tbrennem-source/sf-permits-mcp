Eligibility Criteria
To be eligible for parallel processing, a project must meet the following criteria:
FEATURES YES
Number of Units: The development must include either (1) 50 or more
net new dwelling units with no non-residential uses excepting ancillary
ground floor uses, or (2) 250 or more new units along with other, non-
residential uses.
Height: The development must be less than 240 feet in height. Projects
over 240 feet in height require third-party peer review, which adds
complexity that is not conducive to Parallel Processing.
New Construction: The development must be new construction and
not an alteration.
Access to Public Right of Way: The development must not be
landlocked and have legal access to existing public rights-of-way.
Subdivisions & Mergers: The development may include a lot merger
or a new construction condominium application; however, it may not
include any land subdivision application.

PARALLEL PROCESSING PROGRAM AFFIDAVIT
AND STATEMENT OF ELIGIBILITY
PACKET OF INFORMATION
A Joint Initiative of the Planning Department and the Department of Building
Inspection
In response to Mayor Edwin M. Lee’s Executive Directive 17-02, the Planning
Department and the Department of Building Inspection (“DBI”) a voluntary
Parallel Processing Program focused on those Housing Projects defined in
Executive Directive 17-02. This program expands on current parallel processing
options, is offered at no additional cost, and is intended to accelerate housing
production in San Francisco.
Planning Department staff are available to advise you in the preparation of this
application. Call (415) 558-6377 for further information.
WHAT IS PARALLEL PROCESSING?
Parallel Processing is the simultaneous review of a development project by staff at both DBI and
the Planning Department. This approach typically involves DBI’s review of a site or building permit
application for a given project at the same time that the Planning Department reviews the project’s
entitlement application(s), analyzes potential environmental impacts pursuant to the California
Environmental Quality Act (“CEQA”), or completes required neighborhood notification.
WHY USE PARALLEL PROCESSING?
Through Parallel Processing, Project Sponsors can potentially save months of review time compared
to conventional serial processing, provided that the project does not substantially change once
Parallel Processing has begun. Essentially, this process enables both the Planning Department and
DBI to identify project deficiencies simultaneously. While Planning Department approval will
continue to be required prior to permit issuance, through Parallel Processing, in some cases permit
issuance by DBI may be possible soon after Planning Department approval.
ARE THERE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PARALLEL PROCESSING?
While the provisions of this Program are intended to mitigate risks to the maximum extent possible,
project sponsors who choose to enroll projects in the Parallel Processing Program are advised that
potential downsides exist. Specifically, revisions to an element of the project required by one agency
(e.g. the Planning Department) may need to be re-reviewed by the other (e.g. DBI), despite that
element having been previously reviewed. This not only consumes additional time, but creates a risk
of a circular review process when dealing with conflicting Building and Planning Code provisions.
PAGE 1 | PLANNING AFFIDAVIT - PARALLEL PROCESSING PROGRAM V. 12.19.2017 SAN FRANCISCO PLANNING DEPARTMENT

=== PAGE 10 ===
ARE THE STANDARDS OF REVIEW USED IN PARALLEL PROCESSING ANY
DIFFERENT?
No. The standard of review (e.g. Planning Code provisions, Planning Commission policies, CEQA)
is unchanged. Similarly, Building Code requirements are unchanged. This program changes only
process, streamlining the permitting process where possible in order it to increase its efficiency and to
reduce the time required to permit issuance.
The overall Program along with the specific provision contained therein will be evaluated and
amended as appropriate by DBI, the Planning Department, and the Office of Economic and
Workforce Development on a quarterly basis.
AFFIDVAIT AND STATEMENT OF ELIGIBILITY
As a voluntary program, Project Sponsors will be assuming some risk if plans need to be modified
during the review process. Sponsors are required to complete an affidavit declaring they have chosen
to enter into the Parallel Processing Program and are aware that revisions required by one agency
may precipitate revisions from the other agency and that he or she is responsible for any associated
fees that may be required due to DBI back-check reviews or additional Planning Department review
costs. To be eligible for parallel processing, a project must meet the following criteria:
• Number of units. The development must include either (1) 50 or more net new dwelling units
with no non-residential uses excepting ancillary ground floor uses, or (2) 250 or more new units
along with other, non-residential uses.
• Height. The development must be less than 240 feet in height. Projects over 240 feet in height
require third-party peer review, which adds complexity that is not conducive to Parallel
Processing.
• New construction. The development must be new construction and not an alteration.
• Access to public right of way. The development must not be landlocked and have legal access to
existing public rights-of-way.
• Subdivisions & Mergers. The development may include a lot merger or a new construction
condominium application; however, it may not include any land subdivision application.
SUBMITTAL INSTRUCTIONS
Typically, Planning Department review begins prior to DBI review. If Planning Department staff
receives a permit application or Development Application and the Project Sponsor elects to proceed
with parallel processing, the following will occur:
1. The Project Sponsor completes this Affidavit and Statement of Eligibility stating he or she is
aware of the potential risks of the Program.
2. The Project Sponsor submits a building or site permit (if not already submitted) along
with three sets of plans (two for DBI and one for Planning), including the Affidavit and
Statement of Eligibility printed on the cover sheet.
3. Both Planning Department staff and DBI staff commence review.
4. Any revisions submitted will have a revision scope printed on the cover sheet of the
submittal. Revisions required by one agency will be distributed to the other through the
conventional routing process.
PAGE 2 | PLANNING AFFIDAVIT - PARALLEL PROCESSING PROGRAM V. 12.19.2017 SAN FRANCISCO PLANNING DEPARTMENT

=== PAGE 11 ===
PARALLEL PROCESSING COORDINATOR
If a Project Sponsor elects to enter into the Parallel Processing Program, he or she will provide to both
agencies the name of a Parallel Processing Coordinator who will serve as the primary point of contact for
the project. This contact information for the coordinator will be included in the Affidavit and Statement
of Eligibility and is essential to ensure effective communications and responsiveness.
Materials, Windows and Addenda. While both agencies encourage early selection of materials, window
treatment, and landscaping, they may nonetheless be selected later in the review process. In addition, the
Parallel Processing Program does not affect the typical addenda process and these exterior materials are
stipulated in the architectural addenda.
PARALLEL PROCESSING COMMENCEMENT AND RE-ROUTING CHECKLIST
The benefits of Parallel Processing are realized most fully when those building features most critical
to each DBI and the Planning Department have been fully vetted and are no longer subject to change.
Bearing this in mind, the Planning Department has developed a list of project features that, if changed
during the parallel review process, may result in additional review by Planning staff and potentially lead
to increased timelines, and costs, for review. Similarly, the Planning Department will not commence
Parallel Processing for any application until it is satisfied that they are likely to remain unchanged for the
remainder of the review process. These features include but are not limited to the number of dwelling
units, the building’s exterior dimensions, ground floor use types, and the area of commercial square
footage. Similarly, DBI has created a checklist of project features that if changed during the Planning
Department review stage would require re-review by DBI. Please see the items listed below:
• Envelope - height
• Envelope - walls and floors/ceilings
• Envelope - size and location
• Windows - treatment, materials
• Windows - location/configuration
• Architectural detail (e.g. façade, materials)
• Architectural detail – cornice
• Gross Floor Area
• Ground floor configuration and uses (residential)
• Ground floor configuration and uses (commercial)
• Below ground configuration (e.g. parking)
• Dwelling units - number
• Dwelling units - bedrooms in unit
• Dwelling units - configuration (interior and within building)
• Parking/loading spaces - number and location
• Circulation - vertical circulation (stairs, elevator)
• Common open spaces and courtyards
• Landscaping - private property
