INFORMATION SHEET
NO. G-27
DATE : August 28, 2018
CATAGORY : General
SUBJECT : Required Permits Listing for Residential Condominium Unit
PURPOSE : The purpose of this Information Sheet is to create a procedure for
processing Residential Building Record (3R Report) for a Residential
Condominium Unit.
REFERENCES : San Francisco Housing Code Chapter 3.5
DISCUSSION :
Presently when preparing a 3R report for a specific residential condominium unit, many
alteration permits appear in the 3R report which are not associated with that unit. Commonly a
large number of the listed permits include associated fire sprinkler and fire alarm permits which
may not be related to the residential condominium unit. This process creates unnecessary
work for DBI staff and does not provide relevant information to the applicant.
Effective September 1, 2018, a 3R Report for a specific residential condominium unit, will
provide all construction, conversion, or alteration permits issued relevant to the specific
condominium unit. No 3R Reports are processed without an application and payment. The
permits listed shall include but not be limited to:
• New building permit for which a Certificate of Final Completion and Occupancy is issued
for first occupancy
• If the building is a podium building with multiple new construction permits, the New
Construction Building Permit and Certificate of Final Completion for the building for
which the unit is located will be the New Construction Permit included on the 3R Report
• Revisions to the new building permit
• Common Use Area building permits associated with the specific condominium building
