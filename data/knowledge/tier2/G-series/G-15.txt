disturbance of at least 50 cubic yards of soil and in the extended Maher Zone shall be routed to

CPB staff can verify whether the site is in the extended Maher Zone by inputting the address or
block and lot numbers and clicking “Location”. If there is a flag on “Restriction” stating
“Maher Ordinance – Extended”, the site is in the extended Maher Zone.
The extended Maher Zone is city-wide instead of simply along the Bay fill perimeter. Applicant
can also verify whether the site is in the extended Maher Zone by reviewing the maps available
soon in the Planning and DPH websites. If the project involves the disturbance of at least 50 cubic
yards of soil and is in the extended Maher Zone, applicant should submit to DPH for review first,
prior to starting the building permit process.
The above requirement will be exempted if applicant provided site mitigation plan approval letter,
or previously approved permit, or other approval document from DPH. For such case, routing to
DPH is not required.
The following stamp shall be stamped on “description of work” on the building permit application
form:

UNAUTHORIZED UNIT SCREENING REQUEST FORM AND AFFIDAVIT
An Unauthorized Unit, or UDU, is defined in Planning Code Section 317(b)(13) as one or more rooms within a
building that have been used, without the benefit of a permit, as a separate and distinct living or sleeping space
independent from other Residential Units on the property.

Departamento de Planificación requerirá al menos un día hábil para responder
中文: 如果您希望獲得使用中文填寫這份申請表的幫助，請致電415.575.9010。請注意，規劃部門需要至少一個工作日

Tagalog: Kung gusto mo ng tulong sa pagkumpleto ng application na ito sa Filipino, paki tawagan ang 415.575.9010. Paki tandaan
na mangangailangan ang Planning Department ng hindi kukulangin sa isang araw na pantrabaho para makasagot.
CRITERIA FOR AN UNAUTHORIZED UNIT (UDU)
A UDU must meet two criteria:
1. An UDU must be independent from other Residential Units on the property, which means that the space has
independent access, and there is no open, visual connection to a Residential Unit on the property.
2. Use as Independent dwelling Space. A UDU must have been used as a separate and distinct living or sleeping
space.
Please note that the definition of a UDU does not rely on the existence of any cooking facilities, so a space may still be
considered a UDU even if it doesn’t have a kitchen; however a full bathroom is required to be considered a UDU.
Planning Staff may request a UDU screening for permits for interior work to determine if a project removes certain features
that allow the space to operate as a separate unit. Scopes of work that may require UDU screening include but are not
limited to:
• Removal of direct or indirect access doors
• Removal of a full bathroom
• Removal of a kitchen
• Removal of a wet bar
• Addition of a staircase to create an interior connection between floors
SUBMITTAL INSTRUCTIONS
Please complete the form below and submit it to CPC.UDU@sfgov.org with the following
materials:
1. A completed Unauthorized Unit Affidavit (attached);
2. A digital set of existing and proposed plans (.pdf or .jpeg); and
3. Photographs of the space that may be a UDU.
Planning Staff will contact you with a determination if the space in question is considered a UDU.
Please note that if the Planning Department determines that a UDU is present at the site, the property owner will be required to
legalize the unit, which can usually be completed administratively, or seek a Conditional Use Authorization from the Planning
Commission to remove the unit. If a UDU is not present at the site, Planning Staff will review the plans for any unpermitted work on
the premises. Staff may provide comments to bring the work into compliance with the Planning Code, which may include removal
of the unpermitted work. If Planning Code violations persist, Staff may refer the property to the Code Enforcement Division.
