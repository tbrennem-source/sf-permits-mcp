INFORMATION SHEET
NO. S-12
DATE : May 23, 2024
CATEGORY : Structural
SUBJECT : Cross-Laminated Timber
PURPOSE : The purpose of this Information Sheet is to clarify the reference standard for
projects involving cross-laminated timber (CLT) and the procedure to establish
the design standard.
REFERENCE : San Francisco Building Code (SFBC), 2022 Edition
California Building Code (CBC), 2022 Edition

Structures, American Society of Civil Engineers / Structural Engineering
Institute (ASCE/SEI) 7-16 and ASCE/SEI 7-22

Background:
Prior to 2016, the CBC did not have provisions allowing the use of cross-laminated timber (CLT). In the
2022 edition, CBC 602.4 includes provisions for the use of CLT in Type IV construction, and CBC
2303.1.4 allows for the use of CLT elements for gravity loads.
The 2022 CBC’s referenced standard, the 2021 SDPWS, provides design requirements for CLT
diaphragms and shear walls to resist lateral forces. However, the 2022 CBC referenced design standard,
ASCE 7-16, does not recognize CLT systems and therefore does not provide the seismic performance
factors required to determine the lateral loading on a CLT structure.
The newer version of the standard, the ASCE 7-22, provides the necessary seismic performance factors
for CLT systems to determine the lateral loading on the building. However, this newer version of the
referenced standard is not yet adopted into the model code.

INFORMATION SHEET S-12
Discussion:
The Department of Building Inspection recognizes the use of CLT in the lateral force-resisting system
despite the seismic performance factors not yet incorporated in the ASCE7-16 design standard. Thus,
projects utilizing CLT as part of the seismic force-resisting system under the 2022 CBC may request to
employ the updated ASCE 7-22 design standard via Administrative Bulletin AB-005 Procedures for
Approval of Local Equivalencies. This alternate method of compliance for the project must use the ASCE
7-22 design standard in its entirety in lieu of ASCE 7-16.
Conditions deviating from the prescriptive design requirements detailed in 2021 SDPWS and ASCE 7-
22 may be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the plan review supervisor or manager and shall be
subject to approval as an alternative system in accordance with Administrative Bulletin AB-082
Guidelines and Procedures for Structural Design Review.
