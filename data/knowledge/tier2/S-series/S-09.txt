INFORMATION SHEET
NO. S-07
DATE : February 13, 2014
CATEGORY _! Structural
SUBJECT : Interpretation of SFBC Section 3402B, Exception 1
a a
PURPOSE : The purpose of this Information Sheet is to clarify the interpretation of
SFBC Section 3402B, Exception 1
REFERENCE : 2013 San Francisco Building Code
DISCUSSION

The interpretations also involve the application of Section 1604.11, which Exception 1 uses to
check eligibility. Incidentally, since Section 1604.11 is also cited by AB-094, the interpretations
proposed here could have a useful impact on voluntary seismic work as well. —

SFBC Section 3402B Exception 1 reads as follows:

A building that has been seismically strengthened to meet or exceed the standards of
Section 1604.11 of this Code or its predecessor provisions within 15 years prior to the
operative date of this Chapter is exempt from this Chapter upon the submittal of
documentation showing that such work was properly permitted, completed, and
maintained as required by this Code, and that the Department has approved such
documentation.

1. What is the general intent of Section 3402B Exception 1?

The exception exempts certain buildings based on recent permit and construction records,
following the 15-year rule from Ordinance 54-10 (which created AB-094). The intent is to relieve
owners of the expense of hiring an engineer to produce new calculations or over-stamp old ones.

In general, a building should be exempi under Section 3402B Exception 1 if its target stories were
structurally retrofitted within the past 15 years using criteria that matched or exceeded conventional
practices and code-based procedures in place at the time of the retrofit.

2. Section 1604.11 is for triggered retrofits. Does Section 3402B Exception 1 also apply to
past voluntary retrofits?

Yes. The context of Section 3402B and the text of Section 1604.11.1 make clear that Exception 1
applies to voluntary retrofits as well as triggered retrofits.

Section 1604.11 is the City’s traditional standard for triggered retrofit (that is, retrofit triggered by an
addition, alteration, etc.). Any triggered retrofit completed within the past 15 years will be eligible for
Exception 1 by definition. In addition, Section 1604.11.1 reads, “This section may be used as a
standard for voluntary upgrades.” However, Section 1604.11 does not specify which of its
referenced provisions are to apply to past voluntary work. That is the subject of this Information
Sheet.

3. Section 1604.11 references Section 1613, which references ASCE 7. Which provisions
cited by Sections 1604.11, 1613, etc. apply in the context of Section 3402B Exception 1?
When applied to triggered retrofit, Section 1604.11 can involve wind design, nonstructural bracing,
and retrofit of whole buildings. When applied to past voluntary retrofits through Exception 1,
however, it is not the intent that those past retrofits need to have been of the same full scope.
Retrofit scope otherwise outside the intent of Chapter 34B is not required to qualify for Exception 1.
Exception 1 requires only seismic retrofit of the lateral structural system in the building’s target
stories.

Specifically, when used to comply with Section 3402B Exception 1:
e Section 1604.11.2, regarding wind forces, is waived.
e Section 1613 requirements for nonstructural bracing and anchorage are waived.
e Section 1613 requirements are waived for stories above the highest target story.

4. Section 1604.11.3 allows reduced seismic loads for retrofits triggered by Section 3401.10.
Does this allowance also apply when Section 1604.11 is applied in the context of Exception
1?

In general, yes. The “75 percent” reduction factor may be applied to the earthquake loads that
would otherwise have applied to the design of a similar new building at the time of the retrofit. This
allowance is appropriate because the intent of Exception 1 is to acknowledge relatively recent work
that was done to standards current at the time.

Similarly, when checking the design base shear of the past retrofit, submitted documentation
should use earthquake loads and earthquake design parameters (R-values, for example) from a
single code edition, generally either the current code or the code in effect at the time of the retrofit
design. Following 2012 IEBC Appendix Chapter A4 Section A403.3, as modified by AB-107, the
R-value of the retrofit system may be used if applicable irregularities are eliminated.

5. Section 1604.11.3 waives the building separation limit for retrofits triggered by Section
3401.10. Does this waiver also apply when Section 1604.11 is applied in the context of
Exception 1?
Yes. Since the purpose of the waiver is to acknowledge constraints typical to the San Francisco
building stock, this waiver applies to past voluntary retrofits as well, as long as the voluntary retrofit
in question did not involve an intentional softening of any story.

6. What is meant by “predecessor provisions” in the wording of Exception 1? How does
this relate to the 15-year limit or to the May 21, 1973 date given in Section 1604.11?
“Predecessor provisions” refers only to the fact that Section 1604.11 covers topics previously
covered in Section 104(f). It is unrelated to the 15-year limit.

Section 1604.11.1 reads in part, “An existing building or structure which has been brought into
compliance with the lateral force resistance requirements of the San Francisco Building Code in
effect on or after May 21, 1973, shall be deemed to comply with this section ... .” This allowance
applies only to triggered retrofits. It does not apply to retrofits seeking to qualify for Exception 1.

For voluntary retrofits, the intent of Exception 1 is to acknowledge work done to contemporary
standards only. That is, to qualify for Exception 1, a retrofit should have been designed to the
criteria given in Section 1604.11 at the time of the retrofit, without the 1973 allowance. Exception 1
considers retrofits back to 1998, but the criteria for such retrofits should have been the criteria that
were current at the time (or equivalent, subject to approval by the Department).

7. What is required to document that a past retrofit “was properly permitted, completed,
and maintained as required by this Code, and that the Department has approved such
documentation”?

For purposes of applying Exception 1, “properly permitted” means only that the retrofit work in
question was done with permits and was subject to the review processes normally performed by
the Department at the time of the retrofit. It is not necessary that the retrofit permit application or
désign or construction documents cited Section 1604.11.

For purposes of applying Exception 1, “completed” means only that the work as built must match or
exceed in scope the work shown on plans and calculations submitted to qualify for Exception 1. In
most cases, a certificate of final completion, or other documentation showing that the Department
completed its normal construction reviews, will be sufficient.

For purposes of applying Exception 1, “maintained” means only that the permitted and completed
retrofit work has not been altered since its completion, either with or without a permit. This provision
is not intended to require a new condition assessment or compliance review relative to other
building code provisions.

8. What are the submittal requirements to qualify for Section 3402B Exception 1? —

As shown in Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Optional Evaluation Form (OEF), a previous retrofit can
qualify for Exception 1 either with documentation of the previous work or with new evaluation
calculations. In either case, the intent of Exception 1 is to allow reliance on records from the
previous retrofit work.

Where documentation of the previous work is submitted (OEF Section 3), it should be
supplemented with an explanation showing that the requirements of Exception 1 have been met.

Where new calculations are submitted (OEF Section 4), submittal requirements should generally
match those required to document a new retrofit design. Construction records (such as
