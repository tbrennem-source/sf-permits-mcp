appointed by the Director:
1. One inspector from Special Inspection Services;
2. One inspector or engineer in Technical Services Division; and,
3. One full engineer or associate engineer with 10 years' experience in structural engineering.
The SI Recognition Committee has developed the following qualification guidelines to facilitate a review
and approval process to allow qualified agencies to perform special inspection in San Francisco.
