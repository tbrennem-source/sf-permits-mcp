Disabled Access Compliance Checklist
Instructions
Step 1: Completely fill out both pages of the Disabled Access (D.A.) Checklist & check all appropriate boxes.
Also, fill out any additional forms as specified on the D.A. Checklist. If you are submitting a revision to a
previously approved permit, then fill out p. 1 of the D.A. Checklist only (Note: a revision is considered to be a
slight modification to the original approved permit drawing set, not new or additional work). The original
approved plans (or a copy of the original) are required to be brought back for reference in addition to two sets
of the proposed revisions.
Step 2: A. If your project is over the threshold and all existing conditions comply with current regulations:
Check box A on page one, and check all items as fully compliant in column 1 of page 2.
B. If your project is over the threshold and not all existing conditions comply with current regulations:
Check the appropriate box in columns 2 through 7 of page 2, and fill out any required forms as indicated at
the bottom of the page.
If you are providing an equivalent facilitation, fill out and attach the Request for Approval of an Equivalent
Facilitation form. Upon approval, the equivalent facilitation is regarded as code compliant.
If you are claiming a technical infeasibility, fill out and attach the Request for Approval of a Technical
Infeasibility form. Upon approval, the technical infeasibility is regarded as code compliant provided you
comply with the code requirements to the maximum extent feasible.
If any of the elements of the path of travel have been altered constructed or altered in compliance
with the immediately preceding edition of the code (2019 CBC), but do not meet the incremental changes
of the current edition, check the appropriate box in column 5 and provide details as specified.
If an accessible element is non-existent and is not required, check the appropriate box in column 6.
If full compliance with current regulations would create an unreasonable hardship due to financial
constraints, check the appropriate box(s) in column 7, and fill out and attach an Unreasonable Hardship
Request (UHR) form. The Department will review the form and then grant or deny your request. The Access
Appeal Commission (AAC) must ratify all approved UHRs. A UHR that is denied may be appealed to the
Access Appeals Commission.
(See page _____ for details on how to send ratification request or appeal to the AAC.)
C. If your project is under the current valuation threshold:
Check box C on page 1 of the DA checklist. Fill out and attach form C - the 20% Rule. List all items that will
be brought into compliance on form C. The valuation of items on form C should be as close as possible to
20% of the adjusted cost of construction, but is never required to exceed that amount. All items that will not
be brought into compliance due to the cost exceeding the 20% limit should be checked on page 2 of the
checklist in column 6.
Any work that is within the scope of the alteration or addition itself must comply with all of the requirements
of CBC chapter 11B unless specifically exempted by regulation.
Step 3: Is this a City Project?
City Projects are buildings or sites that are owned, leased, or funded by the City of San Francisco. Examples
include but are not limited to City offices and clinics, City occupied leased spaces, libraries, parks, playgrounds
including those built by philanthropic groups on City land, publicly funded affordable housing, and community
development projects. Funding sources include but are not limited to General Obligation Bonds, General
Funds, Recreation and Park Department Community Opportunity Fund, Mayor’s Office of Housing, Mayor’s
Office of Housing and Community Development, Office of Economic and Workforce Development, and state
or federal grants issued to the City.
If your project is not a City Project, skip to Step 4.
City Projects may need to be reviewed Public Works Disability Access Coordinator (PW DAC). PW DAC
reviews projects designed, managed, or built by Public Works (PW). A PW disability access compliance project
sign-off form shall be reproduced on the cover sheet of the plans. If you have questions about a City project,
or want to know whether PW will be responsible for the accessibility review, contact PW at (628) 271-2942.
Step 4: Submittal. Be sure to clearly describe all work on the permit application and follow all instructions as above.
Submit the permit application and plans to the Department of Building Inspection (DBI).

IMPORTANT NOTIFICATION
I. Construction Cost - Field Conditions
1. Construction cost shall be based on the DBI Cost Schedule. DBI may accept bona-fide contract prices
upon review and approval.
2. The cost is used to determine the level of disabled access upgrade for the path of travel to the specific
area of alteration or addition. In general, for projects with construction costs (excluding accessibility
upgrades to the path of travel leading to the specific area of alteration or addition) equal to or below the
valuation threshold (based on the Engineering News Report (ENR) US 20 Cities Average Construction
Cost Index currently $203,611.00). The cost of providing an accessible path of travel to the specific area
of alteration or remodel shall be limited to 20% of the adjusted construction cost.
Projects exceeding the valuation threshold are required to provide a fully accessible path of travel to the
specific area of alteration or addition. Upgrades required by the 2022 California Building Code (CBC)
section 11B-202.4 to the path of travel to the specific area of remodel or addition shall include the primary
entrances (as defined in CBC chapter 2 section 202), restrooms, drinking fountains, public telephones
and signs serving the area of remodel or addition. Full compliance or equivalent facilitation shall be
provided unless doing so will create an unreasonable hardship. In a case where compliance will create
an unreasonable hardship, the path of travel shall be made accessible to the maximum extent possible,
but in no case shall the cost of compliance be less than 20 % of the adjusted construction cost.
Note: For alterations only, when DBI determines that compliance with applicable requirements is
technically infeasible (as defined in CBC chapter 2, section 202), the element(s) deemed infeasible shall
be considered as compliant with the CBC.
3. Construction cost will be verified during plan check and inspection stages by DBI. In the event that the
cost has to be adjusted above the valuation threshold, then the design may be required to provide full
disabled access compliance.
4. The design professional shall verify existing field conditions and confirm that the information provided on
the plans is accurate to the best of their knowledge. A DBI field or district inspector may issue a Stop
Work Order or Correction Notice if the plans do not reflect the actual field conditions.
II. Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
Two federal laws, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the federal Fair Housing Act, are in effect
and impose federal disability access requirements on construction projects. DBI does not enforce federal law
and will not be checking plans for compliance with these requirements. It is your responsibility to make sure
that your plans are in conformance with federal law.
For information concerning the ADA, contact the Architectural Transportation Barrier Compliance Board at
1-800-872-2253 or the Department of Justice at 1-800-514-0301.
For information concerning the Fair Housing Act, contact Housing and Urban Development at 1-415-489-
6400.
III. Curb Ramps, Sidewalks, or Other Work Within the Public Way
If the project includes the reconstruction of a sidewalk, a curb ramp may be required. Curb ramps shall be
constructed at each corner of street intersections and where a pedestrian way crosses a curb. In the event
that the project triggers requirements for a curb ramp, the permit application will be routed to the Department
of Public Works (DPW). Under certain circumstances, a minor sidewalk encroachment may be required. A
Certificate of Final Completion will not be issued for the project until DPW confirms that required curb ramps
have been completed. Contact DPW at (628) 271-2000 for more information or schedule an inspection.

CBC Chapter 2 Section 202 Definitions:
Technically Infeasible. An alteration of a building or a facility, that has little likelihood of being
accomplished because the existing structural conditions require the removal or alteration of a load-
bearing member that is an essential part of the structural frame, or because other existing physical or
site constraints prohibit modification or addition of elements, spaces or features that are in full and strict
compliance with the minimum requirements for new construction and which are necessary to provide
accessibility.
Unreasonable Hardship. When the enforcing agency finds that compliance with the building standard
would make the specific work of the project affected by the building standard infeasible, based on an
overall evaluation of the following factors:
1. The cost of providing access.
2. The cost of all construction contemplated.
3. The impact of proposed improvements on financial feasibility of the project.
4. The nature of the accessibility which would be gained or lost.
5. The nature of the use of the facility under construction and its availability to persons with
disabilities.
The details of any Technical Infeasibility or Unreasonable Hardship shall be recorded and entered into
the files of the Department of Building Inspection (DBI). All Unreasonable Hardships shall be ratified by
the Access Appeals Commission.

All unreasonable hardship requests will be submitted to the Access Appeals Commission for ratification
when granted by the Department of Building Inspection during plan review.
If your unreasonable hardship request is denied, the plans examiner shall inform you of the reasons for
denying that request. In addition, the plans examiner’s group supervisor shall provide you with a second
opinion regarding the denial. If the Department of Building Inspection denies your request for an
unreasonable hardship, you may file an appeal with the Access Appeals Commission.
