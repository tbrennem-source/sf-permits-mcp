INFORMATION SHEET . DA-11

Because California had accessibility standards in place at the time of the adoption of the Federal Fair
Housing Amendments Act, California Building Code Chapter 11A contains a number of regulations that
differ from and are often considered more restrictive than the Federal statutes. This has often become the
source of misunderstanding and confusion for many users when designing multi-family dwellings in
California. Additionally, much of the language used in Chapter 11A is vague and unclear. This has led to
some disagreements of the code’s intent between designers and plan reviewers, contractors and inspectors
and among building department personnel.

In an effort to determine consistencies and clarifications, we have investigated the three main source
documents for this chapter; the Fair Housing Act Design Manual (FHADM), the 1986 ANSI A117.1
Standard, and A New Horizon, published by the Department of Housing and Community Development
(HCD) effective September 15, 1984. We have also spent considerable time with the staff of HCD reviewing
that the department's files for the history and intent of the code language,

In an effort to clarify some of these issues, HCD has revised much of the language in Chapter 11A in
sizable rewording of the codé sections in the 2010 Edition of the CBC and again in the 2013 Intervening
Code Cycle Supplement effective July 1, 2015.

Based upon these sources, the Department offers the following interpretations that will be considered
consistent with the intent of the code and will be effective as of the date of this Information Sheet:

e Common Use Kitchens: It is important to clarify that by definition, common use areas and kitchens
are facilities whose use is limited to the owners, residence and their guests. If the areas are
available for rent, use or lease by the general public at any time, it then becomes a public use facility
and would be governed by Chapter 11B Sections 11B-212 and 11B-804.

It is also important to note that the FHADM, Chapter 11A and the HCD webpage state that
compliance with both the Fair Housing Act and California State regulations (Chapter 11A) is required
and that when there is a conflict, the more stringent requirements must be followed.

if the.kitchen is truly a common use, then it is governed by Section 1127A of Chapter 11A and the
Fair Housing Design-Manual. Both of these document are silent on “kitchens” but both offer some
guidance on design. The Fair Housing Act Design Manual diagram on page 2.14 shows a common
area kitchen with two notes. The first note states that sinks in common use spaces must comply with
ANSI A117.1 Section 4.19 (attached). The second note stipulates that the knee space below the sink
must be enlarged to 36” to provide a toe turning space if the kitchen is U-shaped and less than 60”
wide.

It should also be noted that the diagram shows full height (36”) cabinets where the dishwasher and
stove are placed, but has a lowered (34”) height sink and 30” work space. It also shows a lowered
food serving / dining area with knee space that appears to be about 60” in length. This is consistent
with Section 1127A.12.4 exception that states that where food or drink is served, a portion of the
main counter 60” in length shail be provided at 34” in height. Section 1127A.12.3 would require knee
and toe space be provided for this 60” section. The requirements for kitchens contained in A New
Horizons stipulated that the minimum width of a kitchen in a covered dwelling must be a minimum of
48". This was carried forward into 11A and must be followed.

To summarize, a common use area kitchen must contain the following elements to be considered
compliant with California Chapter 11A:

- Counters may be at the standard 36” height, except;
o Sink and 30” work space at 34” in height
o A 60” portion of the main counter where food is served at 34”

INFORMATION SHEET DA-11

~ The kitchen sink and work area must provide knee and toe space, the hot water line and
drain must be insulated, The knee space at the sink must be 36” in width if the kitchen is U-
shaped and less than 60” wide (48”) to provide a tee turning space;

~ The kitchen must be a minimum of 48” between the face of the cabinets and the opposing
wall or face of appliances (not including handles);

~ All switches, receptacles and controls must be within reach ranges. Controls must be located
on the front of a cooktop or oven and may not require reaching over the burners to operate:

- All switches and controls must be operable with one hand, and be a maximum of 5 Ibs. of
pressure to operate;

- All floors and changes in level must comply with Division lil of 117A and Chapter 2 of the
FHADM.

The Department may also approve kitchens compliant with Chapter 11B or any of the six “Safe
Harbors” listed in the FHADM preface on a case-by-case basis.

Garbage Disposals in Dwelling Unit Kitchens: In Information Sheet DA-03, the Department
responded to clients who had stated that they did not believe garbage disposal were allowed under |
sinks in adaptable kitchens. After discussion with both Fair Housing First and HCD, it was
determined that neither the Fair Housing Act nor Chapter 11A prohibits the use of garbage
disposals. What was not made clear is that although garbage disposals are not prohibited, their use
is modified by other sections of the code. At the time of initial installation, a garbage disposal must
not infringe upon the required knee space under the sink. HCD, in the July 1, 2015 supplement, has
clarified the language regarding knee and toe space requirements to insure that they are better
understood. Section 1133A.3 has been rewritten to say “Sinks and work surfaces...” “...shall be
provided with knee and toe space complying with Section 1133A.”

The FHADM on page 7.15 shows a diagram titled “Knee Space at Sink with Garbage Disposal and
Pipe Protection Panel.” In this diagram, it shows the required 27” high knee space going back 8”
unencumbered by the disposal. The caption at the side of the diagram states a 9” deep sink is
allowed and a rear drain preferred.”

The average kitchen cabinet measures approximately 24” maximum. Centered exactly on a 24”
cabinet, an 8” disposal would extend 4” in front of center leaving exactly 8” that is the required
amount for the knee space. The average disposal i is between 12” and 14” in depth. At an average of
13”, the disposal would have to taper to a maximum width of 2” to 4” at its base in order to maintain
compliance. This is an unrealistic dimension; therefore it would appear mandatory that a rear drain
sink be installed if a garbage disposal is to be included. Unless the designer can provide proof that
the required knee and toe space will be maintained at time of installation, the Department will
require rear drain sinks on all kitchens equipped with garbage disposals.

Bathroom Showers / Shower Enclosures: In the 2010 edition of the California Building Code,
HCD rewrote Section 1134A.2 Number of complying bathrooms in order to clarify a number of
points, One of these clarifications was the requirement that if a covered dwelling contains a shower
stall, at least one shower stall must comply with Section 1134A.6. This is specified in Option #2,
Item #6 of Section 1134A.6 which states that if a bathtub is selected to comply with Option #2, Item
#6 (and there is a shower stall in the dwelling unit) “...at least one shower stall within the dwelling
unit shall meet all the applicable accessibility requirements...”. This is again restated in Section
1134A.6 “When one or more shower stalls are provided within the same dwelling unit, at least one of

Page 3 of 5

INFORMATION SHEET DA-11

the shower stalls shall comply with one of the following requirements” (followed by the three options
for accessible shower stalls). In conversations with HCD, it was made clear that this requirement
would also apply, even if there is only one bathroom and it contains a shower stall and a tub. You
would not be required to make both the shower and the tub accessible if there is only one bathroom,
but the shower stall must comply; the tub is optional if you choose Option #2. It should be noted that
there is no requirement to provide a shower stall within a dwelling unit, but if they are provided, at
least one shall comply.

The question of shower doors is often raised. Shower doors are allowed with some restrictions.
Section 1134A.6 #7 specifies that the enclosure must be constructed of “approved shatter proof-
resistant material,” glazing shall be tempered or laminated safety glass complying with Chapter 24, :
or approved plastic. Hinged doors shall swing outward. A shower door that is surface mounted and
attached with screws to the walls may be installed on any of the three shower options as it is easily
removed and thus readily adaptable without special tools or knowledge.

A shower door that is recessed into the tile work or which would require a trained craftsman to
remove may be installed only on Option #1.1 and Option #1.3 type showers if the following
conditions are met:

- The door must provide a clear 36” opening when open 90 degrees, the door must comply
with Section 1132A.5 with a 39” clear space at right angles to the door in its closed position
and provide for an 18” strike side maneuvering space.

- The door must have an opening force of 5lbs maximum and be operable with one hand and
not require pinching grasping or turning of the wrist.

- Additionally, any shower door that is permanent in nature must not interfere with the use of
the required clear floor space for the shower.

Entry Doors: The question was raised as to the required height of a viewing port in a front entry
door. Although it would be courteous to provide a lower viewing port at a height that is usable by
persons in mobility devices, there is no requirement in Chapter 11A for this. Section 1003A.2.2 of
the San Francisco Building Code, however, does restrict door viewers to a maximum height of 58
inches.

Although Chapter 11A has no specific regulations for door viewers, guidance for installation of door
viewers may be taken from Chapter 11B. In Section 11B-809.5.5.2, the code requires a door be
equipped with a means of identifying a visitor without opening the door and allow for a 180 degree
view. The associated advisory recommends the use of a prism type peep hole as these can be used
by all persons, standing and in wheelchairs. This also would eliminate the problem noted by HUD of
criminals identifying units occupied by person with disabilities due to the height of the door viewer.

NOTE: If the viewer has a flip open door on it, or it is an adjustable viewer; this is an operable
part and must be mounted within reach ranges and meet the conditions of operable parts. The
reach range requirement would also apply to the required exterior doorbell at each unit entry.
