DISCUSSION

The purpose of this Information Sheet is to clarify the regulations contained in the CBC Chapter 11A,
Section 1133A pertaining to kitchens within individual covered dwelling units in a multi-family dwelling.
There seems to be some confusion as to the requirements regarding distance between cabinets, when
cabinets are required to be removable and when knee and toe space is required. There has also been
disagreement over what depth of sink is allowed, what kind of “bread board” is allowed, if pipes under the
sink are to be insulated, and whether garbage disposals are allowed.

INFORMATION SHEET DA-03

The Initial Statement of Reasons published by the Department of Housing & Community Development
(HCD) in December of 2013 states that Chapter 11A is primarily based upon the ANSI A117.1-1986
Standard. The statement further clarifies that HCD has also developed more stringent requirements in
some areas, such as the requirement for removable bases under sinks in other than U-shaped kitchens.
Chapter 11A contains a number of requirements that are more stringent than the Federal Fair Housing Act
Design Manual, which is also based upon the 1986 ANSI standard.

The statement of reasons expresses HCD’s intent to clarify these provisions in the proposed intervening
code cycle language and reinforce “that the requirements for parallel and forward approach, knee and toe
space, removable base cabinets and repositionable countertops apply to kitchen sinks and work
surfaces.”

In discussion with HCD, it has been determined that they take no position on the definition of “bread
board” as referenced in Section 1133A.4 exception and they rely upon the local jurisdiction to make such
a determination. This department's interpretation is derived from the language and implied intent of the
1986 ANSI Standard, the input of a number of other jurisdictions and members of the Certified Access
Specialist Institute.

The following are the HCD’s interpretation of these regulations:

Clear Floor Space: 1133A.2

The code requires that all fixtures and appliances have a clear floor space centered on the fixture allowing
either a parallel or forward approach except for a range or cook-top. For a cook top or range, a front
approach is optional, however a parallel approach must be provided as this approach provides greater
safety for the user per the Fair Housing Act Design Manual.

Clear Width: 1133A.2.1
The California Building Code differs from the Federal Fair Housing Act Design Manual and from the 2010
ADA Guidelines regarding minimum width of kitchens. The California minimum width is more restrictive
and thus must be applied.
e Where there is a U-shaped kitchen providing only a parallel approach to a cook top or range at the
base (i.e. no removable base cabinet), the minimum width between counters and appliances is
60”.
e Where there is a U-shaped kitchen with removable cabinets that will provide compliant knee and
toe space when removed underneath a cook top or sink at the base, the minimum width shall be
48” between appliances and counters.
e All other conditions, including distance to islands, shall be 48” minimum in clear width.
The clear width is measured from the face of the cabinet or edge of counter top to the opposite wall,
counter or appliance. It is the duty of the design professional, as well as the plan checker and the field
inspector to verify the dimensions of the appliances, particularly stove and refrigerators, to assure that
they do not violate the minimum clear width requirement when installed.

Removable Base Cabinet: 1133A.3
The California Building Code requirements for removable base cabinets also differ from the Federal
regulations and are more restrictive. California requires:
¢ One 30” sink cabinet having a removable base that will provide for a clear 30” wide knee and toe
space when removed. In addition, there shall also be one 30” counter top work surface cabinet that
will provide for a clear 30” wide knee and toe space when removed. In lieu of two separate 30”
cabinets, a single 60” removable cabinet may be used.

Page 2 of 4


--- Page 3 ---
INFORMATION SHEET DA-03

e For smali kitchens where there is limited wall and cabinet space, two 15” bread boards may be
used in lieu of the 30” counter top workspace cabinet. As there is no provision for this in the
Federal codes, and neither California or the Federal codes has any exception for knee space
under work areas, these bread boards must be installed in a manner that will provide for knee and
toe clearance when in use. The most common type of bread board would be the pull-out or swing-
out style that was common at the time the code was first written.

e The finished floor must extend to the back wall under all removable base cabinets.

Knee and Toe Space: 1133A.7
Knee and toe space is required under kitchen sink and workspace. Knee and toe space shall comply
with 1133A.7 and 1138A.2.
« The knee and toe space shall be 30” wide clear. This space shall be centered on the fixture.
e The knee clearance shall be 27” minimum in height and extend back a minimum of 8” from the
front edge. The knee space may then decrease by 6” vertical for each 1” horizontal for a total of
18” (3 x 6”) to 9”, (27” — 18”).
e The toe clearance shall be a minimum of 9” in height, begin at a minimum of 11” deep.
e Combined knee and toe clearance shall extend at least 19” minimum under both the sink and the
workspace (1138A.2.1.3).
e Clear floor space shall extend a maximum of 19” into the knee and toe space.

Plumbing Protection: 1133A.7.1
Water supply and drain under kitchen sink shall be insulated and free of sharp edges.
Notes:
* Although it is not required, it is recommended to insulate the bottom of a cook top when removable
cabinets are provided to prevent users from undetected burns.
e Garbage disposals are not prohibited by code and may be allowed.
e California does not prescribe a 6.5” maximum depth for a sink, as does the Federal code, but the
. depth is restricted by the required knee space. For a standard 36” high cabinet* a self rimming sink
would be allowed to be 9” deep if the space below the sink was 27” clear in height. For larger
double sinks, the deeper portion may extend below 27” provided there is one sink that has a 30”
wide clear space at 27” high beneath it.

Reach Ranges: 1138A.3

Reach ranges apply to kitchen cabinets and all switches and receptacle must comply. The maximum
height of the switches and receptacles for front approach shall be 44” for cabinets between 20” and 25” in
depth, measured from the edge of the counter top. The maximum height of the switches and receptacles
for parallel approach shail be 46” for cabinets between 10” and 24” in depth, measured from the edge of
the counter top. Cabinets over 25” in depth for front approach or 24” in depth for parallel approach must
have switches and receptacles placed in an area other than the back wall such as the counter top or
cabinet face that complies with the allowable reach ranges.

Cabinet Height: 1138A.3.2, #2 exception
In the July 1, 2015 supplement to Chapter 11A, the following exception was added to Chapter 11A,
Section 1138A.3.2, #2:
“Exception: Kitchen countertops in dwelling units, and the top of washing machines and clothes
dryers shall be permitted to be 36 inches (914 mm) maximum above the floor.”

Prior to this supplement, the California code was silent on counter height inside dwelling units, but the

Federal Fair Housing Design Manual has always allowed a 36” counter height as specified on the diagram
on page 7.2 (Attachment C). The change in the California code was introduced as a clarification and not a

Page 3 of 4

INFORMATION SHEET DA-03

regulatory change. The 36” counter height has always been allowed within the dwelling unit, although not
specified. It should be noted that this exception applies only to kitchens within adaptable units and does
not apply to kitchens in accessible units, public spaces or in common use areas.

21. SECTION 11324
DOORS

Section: 1132A.3 Width and height of Interior doors and secondary exterior doors.

Rationale: HCD proposes to amend Item 2 of Section 1132A.3. The proposed amendment allows the installation
of any width if the requirement for 32 inches clear door opening is met. This clarification is a result of comments
received from stakeholders expressing concerns that the allowance of a 34-inch wide door creates the illusion
that the 32-inch clear opening is not required. ‘

HCD believes that the language, as written, is sufficiently clear and describes the intent. However, HCD agrees
to provide clarification and avoid the confusion among some code users. There is no intended change in
regulatory effect. ,

. Section: — 1132A.5 Maneuvering clearance at doors.
1132A.5.1 General.

Rationale: HCD proposes to amend Section 1132A.5.1. HCD proposes to repeal Exception 2, and relocate the -
same language as the first paragraph of this section. HCD also proposes to modify Exception 1, clarifying its
application (applicable to interior doors). :

HCD believes that the existing Exception 2 is not an exception, but the general requirement for maneuvering
clearances at doors. The proposed amendment provides clarity to the code user. There is no intended change in
regulatory effect.

Section: 1132A.9 Smooth surface,

Rationale: HCD proposes to amend the above referenced section. HCD proposes to repeal existing language,
addressing the smooth surfaces required for the bottom 10 inches of a door, and replace it with new language
consistent with Section 11B-404.2,10. HCD also proposes to amend the existing exception and add two new
exceptions consistent with Section 11B-404.2.10.

Section 1132A.9, as written, requires smooth uninterrupted surface on the bottom 10”, both sides. In comparison,
Section 11B-404.2. 10 clarifies that 10” are measured from finish floor, not from the bottom of the door, and are
required on push side only. Section 1132A.9 also requires all doors and/or gates to have a smooth, uninterrupted
surface; however, this section does not specify how big this surface should be. In comparison, Section 11B-
404.2.10 clarifies the area — the full width of the door. .

_ HCD took all concerns into consideration and proposes to modify this section for consistency with
Section 1426A and Section 11B-404.2.10.

22, SECTION 1133A
KITCHENS

Section:1133A.2 Clear floor space.
Section: 11334.3 Removable base cabinets.

Rationale: HCD proposes to amend the above referenced sections, HCD proposes to repiace existing language
with new language that more accurately describes the intent. The proposed modification clarifies that the
requirements for parallel and forward approach, knee and toe space, removable base cabinets, and :

“Tepositionable countertops (see Section 1133A.4.1) apply to kitchen sinks and work surfaces, Stakeholders anc
other code users expressed a concern that currently the language, as written, is not as clear because it seems
that the removable base cabinets are required under work surfaces only when repositionable countertops are
required.

The Development of Chapter 11A and many of its current provisions date back to the 1986 ANSI A117.1: this
was the primary document that HCD utilized. In some areas, HCD has promulgated more stringent requirements.
The requirement for removable base cabinets under work surfaces is from ANSI A117.1 1986, Section 4.32.5.4.
This is where and why HCD has consistently determined the provisions were also intended as a Chapter 11A
requirement. However, some stakeholders successfully pointed out that HCD’s language is not as clear.

Attachment A.1:

i
;

HCD regulations went further than ANS] 1986 by also requiring removable base cabinets under the kitchen sink
(1986 ANSI A117.1 only requires removable base cabinets at sinks in a U-shaped kitchen configuration).
Therefore, HCD believes the intent has been (and continues to be) to require removable base cabinets under
work areas, no different from that of the 1986 ANSI A117.1.

The proposed amendments in Sections 1133A.2 and 1133A.3 provide clarity and consistency to the code user,
There is no intended change in regulatory effect.

Section: 1133A.4 Countertops.

-Rationale: HCD proposes to amend the above referenced section by deleting the reference to

Section 1133A.4.1. HCD believes that this sentence is not necessary since Section 1133A.4.1 is a subsection of
Section 1134A.4, and follows the exception. It would be necessary if it were in a different chapter or division.
Additiopal editorial corrections are also proposed for clarity. There is no intended change in regulatory effect.

Section: 1133A.4.1 Repositionable countertops.

‘Rationale: HCD proposes to amend the above referenced section. HCD proposes to replace the terms "kitchen
sink and work surface space” and “kitchen sink counter area and work surface” with “sinks and work surfaces.”
This modification is a result of comments received from stakeholders expressing a concern that the use of
different terms in the same section creates confusion. HCD proposes “Sinks and work surfaces” as a better
combination of terms to be used in Section 1133A. HCD also proposes fo amend Exception 2, clarifying that the
repositioning is not required for breadboards used in lieu of countertop work surfaces.

The ptoposed modification of Section 1133A.4 provides clarity to the code user. There is no intended change in
regulatory effect. ,

Section: 1133A.7. Knee and toe space.

Rationale: HCD proposes to amend the above referenced section. HCD proposes to repeal existing language
addressing size of knee and toe spaces, and instead refer to Section 1138A.2. Section 1138A.2 was adopted
during the 2012 Triennial Code Adoption Cycle; it contains the technical requirements for knee and toe spaces.
The proposed amendment is consistent with Section 1127A.3, which also was amended during the

2012 Triennial Code Adoption Cycle. , ;

Currently, five sections in Chapter 11A provide different language addressing knee and toe space. HCD intends
to make all sections consistent by referring to Section 1138A.2 for the technical requirements and leaving only
specific details in these five sections. The proposed amendment provides clarity. There is no intended change in
regulatory effect. . .

Section: 1133A.7.1 Plumbing protection.

Rationale: HCD proposes fo amend the above referenced section, providing consistency with
Section 1127A.3. There is no intended change in regulatory effect.

23. SECTION 41134A
BATHING AND TOILET FACILITIES

Section:1134A.5 Bathtubs.

Rationale: HCD proposes to amend Item 1 of the above referenced section. The proposed amendment
‘incorporates language from the FHADM, and clarifies the location of bathtub controls and the required clear floor
space. There is no intended change in regulatory effect. ,

Section:1134A.7 Water closets.

Rationale: HCD proposes to amend the above referenced section. HCD proposes to modify Item 1, clarifying
that the location of water closets shall permit a grab bar installation on at least one side of the fixture. The
proposed amendment provides clarity and is based on comments received from stakeholders. There is no
intended change in regulatory effect. ,

' As we discussed on the phone, during this rulemaking (2013 intervening Code Adoption Cycle), HCD
proposes to amend Section 1133A (Kitchens). The proposed modification clarifies that the
requiremenis for parallel and forward approach, knee and toe space, and removable base cabinets
apply to kitchen sinks and work surfaces. HCD's proposal is a result of comments received from
stakeholders, expressing a concern that currently (in 2013 CBC) the language, as written, is not
sufficiently clear, and could be interpreted incorrectly. HCD’s Final Express Terms (FET) were sent to
the Building Standards Commission; the Building Standards Commission meeting is scheduled for
July 22, 2014. If approved, the amended section will become effective on July 1, 2015. You can use
the Jinks below to access HCD’s Express Terms and the Initial Statement of Reasons.

Historically, HCD has maintained a consistent response in regards to the removable base cabinets in
kitchens, similar to my verbal response onthe phone. The development of Chapter 17A and many of
its current provisions date back to the 1986 ANSI A117.1. This was one of the primary documents
that HCD utilized in the development of Chapter 11A; although, HCD has promulgated more stringent
requirements in several areas. The requirement for removable base cabinets for work surfaces
originates from 1986 ANSI A117.1, Section 4.32.5.4. HCD has consistently maintained this.as a
Chapter 11A requirement; although, there are some who feel that HCD’s language in Section 1133A
is not as clear. HCD intends to continue adopting requirements for removable base cabinets at work
surfaces, no different than in the 1986 ANSI A117.1.
