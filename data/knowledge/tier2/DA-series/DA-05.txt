INFORMATION SHEET
NO. DA-04
DATE : July 24, 2024
CATEGORY : Disabled Access
SUBJECT : The Use of Power Door Operators in Lieu of Level Landings at Doors
PURPOSE : The purpose of this Information Sheet is to detail an equivalency which satisfies the
requirement to provide level landings adjoining exterior and interior doors of existing
buildings which are required to be accessible to persons with disabilities.

Information Sheet DA-02, Disabled Access Upgrade Compliance Checklist Package
BACKGROUND :
Many existing San Francisco buildings are not constructed to allow for level landings as required in CBC 1126A.2
and CBC 11B-404.2.4. Due to a variety of constraints, many buildings are unable to achieve the required maximum
¼” per foot slope and cross slope at doors as required to achieve the code-prescribed accessible path of travel.
New or altered entrances must comply with the code requirements to the greatest extent feasible.
This Information Sheet outlines circumstances under which a power door operator may be installed in lieu of a level
landing. A technical infeasibility request and an equivalent facilitation request can be approved for such conditions
if approved power door operator is installed, along with documentation that strict compliance with the code
requirements cannot be met due to site constraints, as defined in the CBC 202 Technically Infeasible. An Approval
of Technical Infeasibility Request form and an Approval of Equivalent Facilitation Request form must be submitted
as part of the permit plans. Refer to Information Sheet DA-02 for these forms and detailed instructions.
DISCUSSION :
An entrance which complies with this Information Sheet will be considered accessible to and usable by persons
with disabilities and in compliance with other code requirements for level landings.

INFORMATION SHEET DA-04
Ministerial approval may be granted for the use of power door operators in lieu of level landings if the following
conditions, as applicable, are met:
1. Slopes at landings on either side of doors do not exceed 1:12 (1:13 is recommended for construction
tolerance) and is the most gradual slope reasonably achievable. Slopes may extend under the door.
2. Slopes between levels at doors do not exceed 6” in elevation and do not require handrails. Slopes shall be
roughened or made of slip-resistant material.
3. The power door operator must be maintained in operating condition.
4. The power door operator must be operational whenever the door is unlocked.
5. The power door operator controls (sensing devices, push plates, vertical actuation bars or other similar
operating devices complying with CBC 11B-205) are to be placed in a conspicuous location on both the
push and pull sides of the door. The controls must be within sight of the door. Vertical actuation bars are
preferred.
6. The door operator push plates must be at least 4 inches in diameter or at least 4” by 4” square and display
the International Symbol of Accessibility in compliance with CBC 11B-703.7.2.1.
7. At each location where push plates are provided there shall be two push plates. The centerline of one push
plate shall be 7” minimum and 8” maximum above the floor or ground surface and the centerline of the
second push plate shall be 30” minimum and 44” maximum above the floor or ground surface. See CBC
11B-404.2.9.
8. At each location where vertical actuation bars are provided, the operable portion must be located such that
the bottom edge is no more than 5” above the floor or ground surface, and the top edge is at least 35”
above the floor or ground surface. The operable portion of each vertical actuation bar must be at least 2”
wide and must display the International Symbol of Accessibility in compliance with CBC 11B-703.7.2.1.
9. Power door operating devices shall be outside the swing of the door. Provide a level clear floor space for
forward or parallel approach, compliant with CBC 11B-305, centered on the operating device.
10. Signage shall be provided in accordance with ANSI/BHMA A156.19 Section 6.3. Additional signage shall
be provided on or adjacent to the door, preferably on the strike side, indicating the location of the door
operator controls if the control equipment is not immediately obvious to users.
11. The minimum time from door being fully open to the start of door closing shall be as indicated in the following
table:
DISTANCE (feet) TIME (seconds)
0 to 6 5
7 to 8 6
9 to 10 7
11 to 12 10
Distances over 12’ are not allowed.
The distance shall be established from the center of the door to the center of the farthest operator control.
12. Equipment installation shall be in accordance with the manufacturer’s product listing and ANSI/BHMA
A156.19 and ANSI/BHMA A156.10 as applicable.
