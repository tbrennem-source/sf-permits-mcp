City and County of San Francisco Daniel Lurie, Mayor
Department of Building Inspection Patrick O’Riordan, C.B.O., Director
INFORMATION SHEET
NO. G-20
DATE : August 29, 2025
CATEGORY : General
SUBJECT : Interim Criteria - Building Permit Application Routing to City Agencies
PURPOSE : To establish interim criteria for determining when building permit applications and
permit revisions are to be referred by the Department of Building Inspection to
other City agencies for their review and approval prior to permit issuance.
SECTION(S)
INVOLVED : San Francisco Building Code, Section 106A
DISCUSSION :
(A) This Information Sheet supersedes all previously issued documentation on routing.
Since the routing criteria changes according to the needs of the various City Agencies, it is necessary to
update the routing criteria from time to time.
To report any error/omissions in the Information Sheet, please contact Technical Services Division by
email: techq@sfgov.org.
(B) Building Permit Application processing:
Building permit applications, renewals of expired permits, and permit revisions that fall under the
categories listed in Attachment 1 shall be referred by the Department of Building Inspection to the
specified agencies for review.
Building permit applications, renewals of expired permits, and permit revisions that are not within these
categories need not be referred to other agencies unless DBI staff believes that referral is necessary to
assure adequate and complete plan review or unless another agency specifically requests the referral of
a permit application, renewal or revision.
The intent of this Information Sheet is to provide for the proper referral and review of building permit
applications and permit renewals and revisions, including related submittal documents, to City agencies
having jurisdiction over proposed elements of the project. The referral of building permit applications and
permit renewals and revisions to appropriate City agencies for review is recognized as an important
component of the plan review process.
City agencies not responsible for approval of permit applications, such as San Francisco Unified School
District, will not typically have applications or revisions routed to them for review, although agencies that
are responsible for collection of fees relating to construction may review applications for fee
determinations prior to permit issuance.
Building Permit Applications that fall within the categories listed in Attachment 1 are to be referred to the
agency under which the category is listed.

INFORMATION SHEET G-20
When a permit that was previously issued has expired with no work started, a permit application to renew
such previously issued permit should be referred to other agencies as follows in accordance with the
items noted in Attachment 1:
1. Planning Department (Planning) which is also known as City Planning – Zoning Counter (CP-
ZOC)
2. Department of Building Inspection: Architectural and Structural Plan Review (BLDG)
3. Department of Building Inspection: Mechanical Plan Review (MECH) / Electrical Plan Review
(MECH-E)
4. Fire Department (SFFD)
5. Department of Public Works, Bureau of Street-Use and Mapping (BSM)

changes from the site permit. Planning shall be the last station for architectural addendum.
For existing buildings, unless specially requested by Planning, architectural addendum need not be
routed to Planning if no changes from the site permit.
(E) In OCII areas, permits will be routed to OCII instead of to Planning. OCII is the last station to
review. Note that OCII reviews all permit addenda.

2. Route to Planning for review/approval (with reference drawings of the original site permit).
3. Set of altered site permit plus reference drawings will be assigned to the original plan
reviewer.
4. Original site permit shall remain active paired with altered site permit.
5. If any addendum of the original site permit has been issued, no altered site permit will be
allowed.
6. All addenda shall be under the altered site permit.
7. Fees due by the issuance of all addenda shall be based on both the altered site permit and
the original site permit.
8. The Certificate of Final Completion (CFC) of both the altered site permit and the original site
permit shall be issued together at the same time.
