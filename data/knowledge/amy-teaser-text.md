### Option A: The "Holy Shit" Text
> Hey Amy! So you know how I've been doing the AI thing — I built something wild and I need your brain. We machine-ingested the ENTIRE SF permitting corpus. Planning Code, all 47 ABs, every fee table, the G-20 routing matrix, the Fire Code — everything. I pointed it at your 199 Fremont project and it nailed the change-of-use routing, flagged the A-2 occupancy trigger, pulled the right plumbing fees from Table 1A-C. It even knows you used AB-004 priority processing on 600 Battery. I need 90 min of your time to tell me everywhere it's wrong. Coffee or wine — your call.

### Option B: The "I Need Help" Text
> Hey Amy — I've been building something for permit expediters and I'm at the point where I need someone who actually knows what they're doing to tear it apart. We've ingested every published SF permitting doc and built a decision tree that routes projects through all 7 steps. It's scary accurate on paper but I know there's a whole layer of "how it actually works" that's not in any document. That's you. Can I get 90 minutes this week? I'll bring coffee and my laptop.

### Option C: The Direct Ask
> Amy — quick favor. Building an AI tool for SF permit routing. Fed it your restaurant conversion scenario from 199 Fremont and it predicted the 5 agency reviews correctly. But I know the published docs are only half the story. Need your expertise to find the gaps. 90 min over coffee this week?

### Recommended: Option A
Amy is family. Lead with excitement, show the work, make it personal with her actual projects. The "holy shit" energy is authentic and she'll immediately understand the scale of what you built. The 199 Fremont + 600 Battery AB-004 references prove this isn't vaporware — you did your homework on HER work specifically, which shows respect for her expertise.

### Context for the Conversation
When she asks "how did you know about 600 Battery?" — be fully transparent:
- "We pulled the DBI contacts database and cross-referenced your permits. You've done 171 that we can find. The 505 Mission Rock tower, the Bayview townhomes, the 799 Van Ness gym conversion — we have the whole portfolio."
- This isn't creepy because it's all public data and she's a close friend. It shows thoroughness.
- The credibility moment is: "We know what you've DONE. Now we need to know what you KNOW."
