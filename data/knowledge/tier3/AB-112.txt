1)Â Â Â DISCUSSION
Approved construction documents and completed projects must conform to
requirements established in the San Francisco Building Code. San Francisco
Building Code
106A.1.17 requires applications for permits submitted after June 1, 2021 to
construct new buildings to be designed and constructed such that all space
conditioning, water heating, cooking, and clothes drying systems are all-
electric, as defined, and prohibits installation of infrastructure, piping
systems, or piping for distribution of natural gas or propane to such uses.
APPLICABILITY
San Francisco Building Code Section
106A.1.17 applies to all permit applications submitted on or after June 1, 2021
proposing to construct one or more new buildings in San Francisco.
In the case of Site Permits, the effective date is the date the Site Permit
application (not an addendum) is filed with the Department of Building
Inspection. Addenda to site permits and revisions to permit applications
received before June 1, 2021 are not required to meet the requirements of San
Francisco Building Code Section
106A.1.17, unless the addenda or revisions change the scope of the project such
that current codes are generally applicable, or such that an exception granted
on the basis of infeasibility is no longer warranted.
Areas Specifically Designated for Commercial Food Service
For projects which submit an initial application for permit:
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â On or after June 1, 2021 and before January 1, 2022: Areas specifically
designated for commercial food service may provide gas piping systems,
fixtures, and infrastructure exclusively for cooking equipment within the area
designated for commercial food service.
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â January 1, 2022 or thereafter: Permission may be granted to install gas
piping systems, fixtures, and infrastructure exclusively to serve cooking
equipment within an area designated for a specific commercial food service
establishment, such as a specific restaurant. To provide sufficient evidence
that gas infrastructure and piping are necessary, the following must be
provided by completing Attachment 3: Application for Exception for Commercial
Food Service:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â°Â Â Â Name of the food service establishment and food service establishment
owner contact information
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â°Â Â Â Specification of the gas cooking appliances proposed, and fuel
consumption rating for each device
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â°Â Â Â For each proposed gas cooking appliance, state the reason gas is
necessary, such as technological availability or specialized food preparation
process.
Projects that contain gas piping systems, fixtures, or infrastructure serving
cooking appliances are by definition â€œmixed-fuelâ€ and subject to applicable
requirements (see Administrative Bulletin
93).
DEMONSTRATION OF COMPLIANCE
San Francisco Building Code Section
106A.1.17 is a provision enacted for protection of health and safety. For
administrative efficiency, no special documentation is necessary for projects
that comply with San Francisco Building Code Section
106A.1.17. Projects that do not seek an exception are to document compliance
via normal documentation requirements and procedures, such as:
Piping Systems and Mechanical Systems
Project submittals providing any construction detail related to piping systems
or mechanical system design must be all-electric and consistent with the
requirements of San Francisco Building Code Section
106A.1.17. Documentation of compliance with California Title 24 Part 6 Energy
Standards shall not include any indication of gas consumption for space
conditioning, water heating, cooking, or clothes drying.
San Francisco Green Building Standards
Administrative Bulletin 93 (Implementation of Green Building Regulations)
provides guidance for understanding which provisions of relevant local
ordinances and state building codes apply to a project, describes
implementation procedures, and provides forms to document compliance.
Compliance with San Francisco Building Code Section
106A.1.17 (or Environment Code Section 706(d)(7) in the case of municipal
buildings), shall be documented as required by Administrative Bulletin
93:
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Permit applications for new construction are not accepted without Green
Building Site Permit Submittal GS-1.
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â The submittal package for each addendum that includes architectural
details must include a Green Building Submittal checklist incorporated into the
project plans indicating the required measures and referencing location of such
features in the construction documents and providing compliance details for
each requirement. For newly constructed buildings, either GS-2, GS-3, or GS-
6 is required with each addendum.
USES NOT SPECIFICALLY REGULATED
An All-Electric Building or Project as defined by San Francisco Building Code
Section 202 relies on electricity as the source of energy for all space
heating, space cooling, water heating, cooking, and clothes drying. In
addition, building permits are prohibited for projects proposing gas piping
systems, fixtures, or infrastructure for decorative uses and lighting or onsite
generation of electricity (except where primarily fueled by onsite digestion of
organic material). Gas piping systems, fixtures, or infrastructure may be
installed strictly to serve areas and systems outside the scope of the
definitions of an All-Electric Building or Project, and a Mixed-Fuel Building,
such as industrial processes.
In projects that include uses not specifically addressed by San Francisco
Building Code Section
106A.1.17.1, all space heating, space cooling, water heating, cooking, and
clothes drying systems must be designed and constructed as all-electric, and
such a project is defined as â€œall-electricâ€ for the purpose of compliance with
San Francisco Green Building Code
4.201.3 and
5.201.1.1.
EXCEPTIONS
Compliance with San Francisco Building Code Section
106A.1.17 and all other requirements for new construction have been determined
to be practical and feasible. An exception may be made only when either:
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â An all-electric project is demonstrated to be physically or technically
infeasible, OR
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Where application of San Francisco Building Code Section
106A.1.17 would violate the terms of an existing development agreement or other
contract with the City.
This bulletin describes the process for determination of infeasibility and
grant of an exception allowing installation of natural gas piping systems,
fixtures, or infrastructure. An exception shall only apply to the extent
necessary to resolve the demonstrated infeasibility, or to the extent required
under the development agreement or other contract.
Some development agreement projects or other multiphase projects may entail
separate applications for permits to construct infrastructure serving an area
versus buildings constructed after infrastructure is developed. San Francisco
Building Code Section
106A .1.17 applies to any application to construct a building submitted to the
Department of Building Inspection on or after June 1, 2021. If a project
sponsor believes that application of San Francisco Building Code Section
106A .1.17 to a phase of development or to an individual building would violate
the terms of a development or other agreement with the City, the project
sponsor may seek a determination using Attachment 4: Application for Review of
an Existing Agreement. Department of Building Inspection staff will refer the
matter to the City Attorneyâ€™s Office to analyze the request for exception and
the extent to which all or part of San Francisco Building Code Section
106A .1.17 will apply.
2)Â Â Â CRITERIA FOR EXCEPTION ALLOWING A MIXED-FUEL SYSTEM OR AREA
San Francisco Building Code Section
106A.1.17 allows for approval of exception allowing gas infrastructure and
piping systems to be installed on a case-by-case basis where All-Electric
construction is demonstrated to be physically or technically infeasible.
Physical or technical infeasibility is understood to refer to an exceptional
situation where:
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â A project proposal cannot be accomplished due to physical or technical
constraints specific to site and occupancy that prohibit elements, spaces or
features necessary for full and strict compliance with all requirements for new
construction;
Â Â Â AND
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â If a specific system or area is served by gas piping systems, fixtures,
and infrastructure, then the physical or technical infeasibility is resolved,
and the project is able to attain full and strict compliance with all
requirements for new construction.
To qualify for such an exception, the project must:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Undergo a Review of All-Electric Feasibility, resulting in a
determination by the reviewers that there is no means by which a proposed
function or service may be provided by an all-electric design compliant with
all applicable codes; and that the proposed function or service can feasibly be
provided if gas piping systems, fixtures, and infrastructure are installed.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Limit installation of natural gas piping systems, fixtures, and
infrastructure to the system or area for which All-Electric design is
infeasible;
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Ensure the area and system served by natural gas piping systems
provides for future conversion to All-Electric, by complying with the
applicable provisions of Electric Ready Design Guidelines (Attachment 1) to the
maximum extent feasible.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Demonstrate that the projectâ€™s modified design provides equivalent
fire-protection and health and safety to All-Electric design.
Financial considerations are not a basis for determination of physical or
technical infeasibility.
Criteria for determination of infeasibility:
Â 
Category       Criteria
               Compliance with Title 24 Part 6 Energy Standards for all-electric design may be
               infeasible only if there is no prescriptive option for compliance with the Energy
A) Energy      Standards, nor an option for compliance under the performance method for any system
Standards      or technology serving the specific use.
               Proposal to install a technology, system, or design not allowed under the Energy
               Standards does not demonstrate infeasibility where all-electric technologies,
               systems, or designs are available for compliance with the Energy Standards.
               All-electric design may be infeasible if:
               â€¢Â Â Â Electric load calculations are prepared for both mixed-fuel design for a
               specific system or area, and all-electric design, with equivalent occupancies,
               functions, and floor area; and
               â€¢Â Â Â The project submits an application for service to the electric utility serving
               the project; and
               â€¢Â Â Â The utility determines that (a) the peak electric demand required for the all-
               electric design option cannot be served, and (b) the peak electric demand requested
               for the mixed-fuel design option can be served under substantially similar
               conditions. Substantially similar conditions shall include equivalent occupancies,
               functions, and floor area, as well as the same consideration of the time required
               for the utility to complete modifications to utility infrastructure, where
               necessary.
               â€¢Â Â Â Where electric service is being provided to a customer by the San Francisco
               Public Utilities Commission (â€œSFPUCâ€), and SFPUC confirms the peak electric demand
               requested for the all-electric design option would directly or indirectly require
               SFPUC to do any of the following:
               Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â Revise a previously submitted application for service to Pacific Gas and
B) Electric    Electric Company (â€œPG&Eâ€) that is still being reviewed by PG&E;
Utility        Â Â Â (ii)Â Â Â Submit a new application for service to PG&E for a load for which there is
Infrastructure an existing service agreement with PG&E;
               Â Â Â (iii)Â Â Â Alter plans for electric infrastructure that have been approved or alter
               infrastructure that are under construction; or
               Â Â Â (iv)Â Â Â Make changes to existing infrastructure that would impair or limit a
               contract right that exists as of the effective date of this ordinance.
               Â Â Â Situations (i) to (iv) above do not represent a basis for a finding of
               infeasibility if the same issue applies to a mixed-fuel design constructed at the
               same site with equivalent occupancies, functions, and floor area. Situations (i) to
               (iv) will only apply to developments where an application for wholesale electric
               service relating to the parcel has been submitted to and deemed complete by PG&E as
               of the effective date of the ordinance, and the project sponsor demonstrates it is
               physically or technically infeasible to build all-electric within the electrical
               capacity constraints documented in existing applications for service to PG&E for the
               purpose of serving buildings that were planned but not yet permitted as of the
               effective date of the ordinance. An over-estimation of ampacity requirements for
               all-electric design compared to mixed fuel is not a basis for exception.
               Under California Public Utilities Commission Rule 2.C, utilities are obligated to
               provide service. Request by the utility for the customerâ€™s proposal to comply with
               applicable tariff, easement, safety, and reliability requirements, or for reasonable
               time to construct improvements, is not a basis for infeasibility.
               All-electric design may be infeasible if:
               â€¢Â Â Â Electric load calculations are prepared for both a design including a specific
               mixed-fuel system and area, and all-electric design, with equivalent occupancies,
               functions, and floor area; and
               â€¢Â Â Â Based on the rules published by the electric utility serving the site:
               Â Â Â Â°Â Â Â Peak electric demand for the mixed-fuel design does not require the
C) Physical    installation of an electric service transformer; and
Constraint in  Â Â Â Â°Â Â Â Peak electric demand for all-electric design with the same features requires
Small Infill   the installation of an electric transformer; and
Sites          â€¢Â Â Â The site has a linear footage of street frontage of 75 feet or less;1 and
               â€¢Â Â Â Joint review by the Planning Department and Public Works Department determines
               there is no feasible option to locate an electrical transformer in the building or
               elsewhere on the property, and:
               Â Â Â Â°Â Â Â The only feasible option is to locate the transformer in a sub-surface vault
               in the public Right of Way; or
               Â Â Â Â°Â Â Â The sidewalk at the site is less than 10 feet in width, such that a sub-
               surface vault in the public Right of Way infeasible.
               All-electric design may be infeasible if
               â€¢Â Â Â It is demonstrated physical or technical constraints specific to site and
               occupancy prohibit elements, spaces or features necessary for full and strict
               compliance with all requirements for new construction; and
D) Exceptional â€¢Â Â Â If gas piping systems and fixtures are substituted for electrical equipment
Circumstance   serving a specific system or area, the project is able to attain full and strict
               compliance with all requirements for new construction.
               Proposal to install a technology, system, or design that is inconsistent with, or
               not allowed by the discretionary determination by a City agency shall not be a basis
               for demonstration of infeasibility.
Â 
3)Â Â Â REVIEW FOR DETERMINATION OF INFEASIBILITY
Compliance with San Francisco Building Code Section
106A.1.17 and all other requirements for new construction have been determined
to be practical and feasible in general. San Francisco Building Code Section
106A.1.17 allows for approval of exception allowing gas infrastructure and
piping systems to be installed on a case-by-case basis where All-Electric
construction is demonstrated to be infeasible.
The conditions of infeasibility depend substantially on design details, and
design development provides substantial opportunity to address physical and
technical conditions. An application for design review for exception due to
infeasibility will not be approved in the absence of substantial architectural
detail, including the architectural addendum and Title 24 compliance
documentation.
Prior to DBI review of an application for exception due to infeasibility, a
Review of All-Electric Feasibility must be completed by engineers with
specialized understanding of electrical engineering, mechanical design, energy
efficiency including compliance with Title 24 Energy Standards, and experience
with the design of all-electric systems for space conditioning and water
heating. In all cases, it is the responsibility of the Design Professional of
Record, with the support of the entire project team, to apply all available
energy efficiency and electric load minimization practices.
Review of All-Electric Feasibility
Review of All-Electric Feasibility is a document that addresses three
questions:
Â Â Â Â°Â Â Â What specific constraint causes all-electric design to be physically or
technically infeasible, but does not apply to mixed-fuel?
Â Â Â Â°Â Â Â Can the constraint be resolved?
Â Â Â Â°Â Â Â Is the area and system proposed served by gas piping systems ready for
conversion to all-electric in the future, and constructed to provide equivalent
health, safety and fire protection?
To address these questions, a Review of All-Electric Feasibility must include:
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Identify the physical or technical constraint: Document the specific
physical or technical issue that results in the infeasibility of All-Electric
design of the project.
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Identify alternatives: Based on review of plans, calculations, and
supporting documentation, identify methods, equipment, and design features
available to resolve the physical or technical issue to mitigate infeasibility.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â°Â Â Â Efficiency: Where the issue relates to peak electrical load, energy
efficiency construction practices, design options, and compliance credits can
commonly contribute to resolving the issue. For the all-electric design,
confirm all available compliance credits have been applied. Confirm all
available energy efficiency design and construction practices have been applied
to all building features contributing to loads regulated by Title 24 Energy
Standards. Confirm equipment specified is no less efficient than prescriptive
baseline specified by Title 24 Energy Standards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â°Â Â Â Mechanical: Review envelope and architectural features and mechanical
design are consistent with minimization of load on mechanical equipment.
Determine whether space conditioning and water heating electric peak load can
be reduced via piping or plumbing design, equipment sizing, equipment layout,
or substitution of equipment type. Mechanical equipment must be no less
efficient than electric prescriptive baseline, where such a baseline is
provided by Title 24 Energy Standards. 2
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â°Â Â Â Electrical: Review electrical panel schedule and load calculations
for the all-electric design. Confirm connected electrical load and demand
electric load for the all-electric design are calculated in accord with
California Electrical Code, and are consistent with the design for compliance
with Title 24 Energy Standards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â°Â Â Â Provide documentation of examples of all-electric design and
construction of similar systems and circumstances.
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Document Available Solutions: Review the mixed-fuel design, and document
the specific area and system proposed as mixed-fuel. Confirm that the physical
or technical constraint will specifically be resolved by granting an exception
allowing mixed-fuel construction of the area and system. Confirm proposed gas
piping systems, fixtures, and infrastructure are limited to the system or area
of the building for which All-Electric design is infeasible.
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Apply Electric Ready Design Guidelines: Areas served by gas piping
systems, fixtures, and infrastructure must prepare for future retrofit to all-
electric by installing sufficient electrical conductors and raceways, bus bar
capacity, and overcurrent protection, and providing sufficient space and
drainage for future replacement of gas systems with electric. Reviewers shall
affirm that the project design conforms to the relevant provisions of Electric
Ready Design Guidelines to the extent feasible.
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Recommendation Regarding Health, Safety, and Fire Protection: Review
construction methods, safety equipment, and design features proposed. Recommend
specific design features, equipment, and construction practices sufficient to
ensure the projectâ€™s modified design provides equivalent fire protection and
health and safety to all-electric design.
Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Documentation of the above via a report addressing each item above in
detail.
Review documentation must be incorporated into plans, with signature by a
reviewer for each discipline (electrical, mechanical, and architectural/Title
24), and stamp by the Design Professional of Record.

PERMISSION TO CONSTRUCT A MIXED-FUEL BUILDING DUE TO INFEASIBILITY
San Francisco Building Code Section
106A.1.17 allows the approval of an exception allowing issuance of a permit to
construct a new mixed-fuel building only on a case-by-case basis. In order to
obtain an exception to San Francisco Building Code Section
106A.1.17, the applicant must:
Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Complete a Review of All Electric Feasibility. This review must be
completed by a third party; individuals employed by a company responsible for
the design or construction of the project may only prepare the review in the
case of Physical Constraint in Small Sites (Category C). Review of All Electric
Feasibility documents the specific area and system proposed to be constructed
as mixed-fuel and the basis for a determination all-electric design is
infeasible.
Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Submit a Request for Approval of Local Equivalency for Modification or
Alternate Materials, Design, or Methods of Construction (Administrative
Bulletin 005), including two copies of the following documentation of the
proposed modification to materials and methods of construction:
Â Â Â Â Â Â a.Â Â Â Project plans specifying the area and system proposed for mixed-fuel
construction
Â Â Â Â Â Â b.Â Â Â Review of All Electric Feasibility
Â Â Â Â Â Â c.Â Â Â Acknowledgement of energy performance requirements that apply to
mixed-fuel design (see Administrative Bulletin 93)
Â Â Â Â Â Â d.Â Â Â Affirmation of the specific provisions of Electric Ready Design
Guidelines (Attachment 1) that pertain to the area and system of mixed fuel
construction. If it is not feasible for the mixed-fuel area or system to fully
comply with the guidelines, the project sponsor shall specify the extent to
which the guidelines are feasible.
Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Review meetings will be conducted by the Department of Building
Inspection, with the Department of Environment and the Fire Department where
applicable, to consider the request for approval of Request for Approval of
Local Equivalency for Modification or Alternate Materials, Design, or Methods
of Construction (Administrative Bulletin 005). Attendance at such review
meetings will include, at a minimum, the Design Professional of Record, the
project mechanical engineer, and the All Electric Feasibility Reviewers.
Â Â Â At such meetings, it is the responsibility of the project applicant to
demonstrate infeasibility. Staff will
Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Review plans, calculations, and supporting documentation for all-
electric options demonstrate all available energy efficiency features,
practices, and credits for third-party reviews specified by the California
Energy Commission contributing to compliance with Title 24 Energy Standards
were applied to the all-electric option.
Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Review alternative technologies and approaches considered prior to
the All Electric Feasibility Reviewers making a determination.
Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Review the mixed-fuel design, including the specific area and system
served by gas piping systems, fixtures, and infrastructure
Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Review conditions proposed to ensure the projectâ€™s modified design
provides equivalent fire protection and health and safety to all-electric
design.
Â Â Â The request will either be:
Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Approved with conditions by DBI with concurrence by Department of
Environment,
Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Placed on â€œholdâ€ pending submittal of additional information, or
Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¢Â Â Â Disapproved.
Â Â Â Determinations as to infeasibility may be appealed to the Board of
Examiners, as established under Section 105.1 of the San Francisco Building
Code. See https://sfdbi.org/board-examiners for details.
Â Â Â The project sponsor is responsible for the hiring of Third Party Reviewers
from the list of approved All-Electric Third Party Reviewers maintained by the
Department of Building Inspection. The project sponsor is responsible for all
costs related to All Electric Third Party Review.
Â Â Â Plan review fees are required to be paid as noted in Administrative Bulletin
005.
Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Upon approval to construct a mixed-fuel building, a copy of the signed
form approving the equivalency and indicating all conditions of approval will
be part of the permanent record of the project, and a copy will be sent to the
project sponsor. The project sponsor shall include all specified conditions in
plans.
PERMISSION TO CONSTRUCT A MIXED-FUEL BUILDING THAT INCLUDES COMMERCIAL
FOODSERVICE
Applications for permit for new construction proposing to install gas piping
systems, fixtures, and infrastructure exclusively for cooking equipment within
the area designated for commercial food service must include the Application
for Exception for Commercial Food Service (Attachment 3), and any foodservice
areas where such systems, infrastructure, and fixtures are approved installed
must be indicated on all addenda and the Final Compliance Verification form
(Attachment 2).
PROJECT COMPLETION
Final compliance verification documentation (Attachment 2) is required prior to
final inspection. No final Certificate of Completion may be issued until All-
Electric Ordinance: Final Compliance Verification has been received, reviewed,
and accepted by the Department of Building Inspection.
Failure to ensure the project is designed and constructed in a manner
consistent with an exception and conditions approved will subject the project
to all of the enforcement and abatement remedies detailed in the San Francisco
Building Code.
LIST OF ALL-ELECTRIC FEASIBILITY REVIEWERS
The Department of Building Inspection with the assistance of Department of
Environment shall conduct an Open Call for Interest and Qualification to Review
All Electric Feasibility to identify professionals with specialized knowledge
and experience in the application of energy efficiency design and construction;
compliance of all-electric systems with Title 24 Energy Standards, and
experience with the design of all-electric systems for space conditioning and
water heating. Department of Building Inspection shall provide upon request a
list of individuals who have provided evidence of holding such qualifications.
Review of All-Electric Feasibility will only be considered when prepared by an
individual holding the appropriate qualifications; selection of reviewers not
specifically listed shall require submission of information to the Department
of Building Inspection establishing the qualifications of each reviewer.
Submittal of substantially inadequate or incorrect analysis will be grounds for
removal from the list of qualified reviewers.
